This C++ source code was used to simulate the cholera epidemic in
Haiti. This work is an extension of an earlier model described in 
the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ("Vaccination 
strategies for epidemic cholera in Haiti with implications for the 
developing world"). This new version allows for multi-year runs
and rainfall-driven cholera transmission.

The code requires five data files: rivers.txt, highways.txt,  
haitipopulation.txt, haitipopulation-dim.txt, haiti-rainfall.txt.  
The first two are derived from OpenStreetMap's data, which I downloaded
from http://labs.geofabrik.de/haiti/2010-11-23-17-44.osm.bz2.
The two population data files were derived from WorldPop's data.
The rainfall data (in mm/day) is from NOAA, downloaded from
ftp://ftp.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/pub/smcd/emb/f_f/hydroest/grads/centralamerica/24hour12-12.

The program requires the GNU Scientific library 
(http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) to compile.
